# Masabi Java Technical Test
We would like you to implement a program that will calculate the average
from a list of integers.  The input will be a list of integers and the output should
be printed to the standard output stream.

The program can be implemented in either Java or Kotlin with a separate module being provided for each.  An acceptance test
has been provided for you in both languages and your first task should be to make this pass.

Please treat this as if you are writing code as part of your job which includes the use of Google, StackOverflow etc.
